    <h3 style="font-weight: 100;text-align: justify;">The system will be a web-based smart store management system
      application. With the help of this application, it can help retail store managers to accomplish the easiest and
      most effective store management, thus helping retail store managers to improve management efficiency and
      performance. The retail store manager can manage the store order information, purchase information, inventory
      information, user information, etc. in real time and accurately. In addition, the system will have features such
      as store delivery and store pickup management, which allows store consumers to shop at any time and in any way. In
      addition, the proposed system is also optimized for inventory management functions, for example, information about
      stock items can be entered and updated in real time through the system, as well as the ability to replenish and
      return goods from suppliers through the system and strictly control every step of the process. This helps retail
      business managers or store owners to manage store inventory more easily and gives them a clearer picture of the
      status of their stores. </h3>
